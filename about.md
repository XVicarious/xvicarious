I'm doing *things*. What are things? All kinds. Generally computer things.

My journey started on my 6th birthday when I recieved a Gameboy Color. It is a moment that is etched in my memory. I remember staring at the screen, thinking how amazing this machine was. It was then that I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I have taken a few detours over the last 20 years, but have never strayed too far away from that initial amazement playing Pokemon: Yellow Version.

I'm looking to, from now on, follow my passions.
